Optimizing Trajectory Tracking Efficiency in Two-Wheel Drive Vehicles     


Designing a robust control system to enhance trajectory-following efficiency and autonomous navigation with advanced 
filtering and path planning techniques (ROS2).


• Modelling a two-wheel drive system and design controllers to improve trajectory-following efficiency. 


• Aim to identify system input parameters to enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.


• Propose using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse IMU, LIDAR sensor and wheel encoder data for improved 
  localization accuracy. 

  
• Developing algorithms for autonomous trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic path planning to enable 
  efficient navigation. (Nav2)
